# MKE Terraform Provider

This terraform provider integrates MKE into terraform via the MKE API.

The API provides nearly all functionality needed, although not all of it is
usabled.

## Implementations

### Provider

The provider is configured per MKE user, pointed at either a load balancer or
one of the MKE master nodes.

```
provider "mke" {
	endpoint = "https://${module.managers.lb_dns_name}"
	username = var.admin_username
	password = var.admin_password
}
```

### Resources

#### ClientBundle

This resource retrieves a new client bundle from MKE.

The resource aims to provide sufficient information to allow configuration
of other providers such as the `kubernetes` provides.

```
resource "mke_clientbundle" "admin" {
	name = "admin" # this actually doesn't do anything, but TF needs at least one attribute.
}
```

This will give you enough data to configure some other providers such as kubernetes:

```
provider "kubernetes" {
	host                   = resource.mke_clientbundle.admin.kube[0].host
	client_certificate     = resource.mke_clientbundle.admin.kube[0].client_cert
	client_key             = resource.mke_clientbundle.admin.kube[0].client_key
	cluster_ca_certificate = resource.mke_clientbundle.admin.kube[0].ca_cert
}
```
If your MKE cluster is swarm-only then .kube will be an empty array, so this will fail.

For docker context you can use something like:

```
provider "docker" {
  host    = "tcp://${module.managers.lb_dns_name}:443"
  ca_material = resource.mke_clientbundle.admin.ca_cert
  cert_material = resource.mke_clientbundle.admin.client_cert
  key_material = resource.mke_clientbundle.admin.private_key
}
```

to get a docker provider configured, which will allow you to run docker containers:

```
# Find the latest nginx precise image.
resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name = "nginx"
}

# Start an nginx container
resource "docker_container" "nginx-server" {
  name  = "my-nginx-server"
  image = docker_image.nginx.latest
}
```


The resource is still under development, and can be considered naive.
